2.1.4
- Modify the page list so that other language trees can also be cached automatically.

2.1.3
- Fix Logger dependency issue in 8.4.5+.

2.1.2
- Listen to the on_cache_warmer_needs_rewarm event. If that event
is fired Cache Warmer will regenerate the cache. This is particularly handy for
custom code that for example flushes the cache of certain pages.

2.1.1
- Fix issue that on_cache_flush was not hooked into.

2.1.0
- Keep track of when the cache is flushed. If the cache is flushed, a config flag is set.
Next time the job runs, it will check if rewarming is needed. With this approach it's possible
to set up Cache Warmer as a cron job that runs every minute, making sure your pages are always fast!
